## üìã Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### Step 1: Provide Your App Idea
Be as specific or as general as you want:

**Specific:**
```
"I want to build a recipe sharing platform where users can:
- Create and share recipes with photos
- Search recipes by ingredients
- Save favorite recipes
- Rate and comment on recipes
- Get nutritional information
- Generate shopping lists
Tech preferences: Next.js, PostgreSQL, deploy on Vercel"
```

**General:**
```
"I need a task management app for teams"
```

### Step 2: Claude Code Analyzes Requirements
Using the INITIAL.md template, Claude Code will:
- Extract core features
- Identify user types
- Determine technical requirements
- Make smart technology choices
- Plan the architecture

### Step 3: PRP Generation
Claude Code creates a detailed Product Requirements Prompt including:
```yaml
project:
  name: "Recipe Haven"
  type: "web"
  description: "A community-driven recipe sharing platform"
  
must_have_features:
  - User authentication
  - Recipe CRUD operations
  - Image upload
  - Search functionality
  - Ratings and comments
  
tech_stack:
  frontend: "Next.js 14 with TypeScript"
  backend: "Next.js API Routes"
  database: "PostgreSQL with Prisma"
  storage: "Cloudinary for images"
  deployment: "Vercel"
```

### Step 4: Implementation Begins
Claude Code follows the implementation guide:

**Phase 1: Foundation**
```bash
# Initialize project
npx create-next-app@latest recipe-haven --typescript --tailwind --app

# Set up database
npm install @prisma/client prisma
npx prisma init

# Configure environment
# Creates .env.local with necessary variables
```

**Phase 2: Core Features**
```typescript
// Implements authentication
// Creates recipe models
// Sets up API routes
// Builds UI components
```

**Phase 3: Testing & Deployment**
```bash
# Runs comprehensive tests
npm run test

# Deploys to production
vercel --prod
```

## üí° Pro Tips

### 1. Provide Context
The more context you provide, the better the result:
```markdown
"I want to build a fitness tracking app.
Context:
- For gym-goers who want to track workouts
- Should work offline
- Need to export data
- Integration with Apple Health preferred
- Budget: Need free tier for 1000 users"
```

### 2. Specify Constraints
If you have specific requirements:
```markdown
"Build a chat app but:
- Must use AWS services only
- Needs to handle 10k concurrent users
- HIPAA compliant for healthcare
- Budget under $500/month"
```

### 3. Include Examples
Reference existing apps:
```markdown
"Build something like Notion but:
- Simpler interface
- Focus on personal notes
- Better mobile experience
- Markdown-first approach"
```

### 4. Iterative Development
You can refine as you go:
```markdown
Initial: "Build a todo app"
After seeing results: "Add recurring tasks feature"
Later: "Integrate with Google Calendar"
Finally: "Add team collaboration"
```
