## üîÑ ITERATIVE REFINEMENT LOOPS

### Self-Validation Protocol
After implementing each feature:

1. **Functional Validation**
   - Does it meet all acceptance criteria?
   - Are all user stories satisfied?
   - Is error handling comprehensive?

2. **Technical Validation**
   - Is the code clean and maintainable?
   - Are best practices followed?
   - Is it properly tested?

3. **Performance Validation**
   - Does it meet performance targets?
   - Is it optimized for production?
   - Are there any bottlenecks?

4. **Security Validation**
   - Are inputs validated?
   - Is authentication/authorization correct?
   - Are there any vulnerabilities?

### Iteration Triggers
- Test failures
- Performance issues
- Security vulnerabilities
- User feedback
- Code review findings
